# Nexperia Code Challenge - Email Outreach Platform with AI Integration

This project is a submission for the Nexperia Tech coding assignment. It demonstrates a functional **Email Outreach Platform** that includes user authentication, email campaign creation, a template editor, and email-sending capabilities. Some additional enhancements are planned for future development.

## Features

   - JWT-based authentication for session management.

2. **Campaign Management**
   - Upload CSV files with email and personalization data.
   - Dynamic template editor supporting placeholders (e.g., `{first_name}`).
   - Integration with email-sending services.

3. **Metrics Dashboard**
   - Track the number of emails sent, pending, or failed.
   - Visualize campaign performance in real time.

4. **AI Integration** (Planned)
   - Generate email content and subject lines using AI.

5. **Error Logging and Validation**
   - Validate email addresses and log failed attempts.
